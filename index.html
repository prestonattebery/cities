      <h1>
        About
      </h1>

      <p>
        BlockCities was inspired by CryptoKitties and the erc721 token standard created in late 2017. I was a digital artist, but had to sell physical prints to actually profit. When I saw CryptoKitties, I knew NFTs would change digital art forever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each building was meticulously designed over the course of two years from 2018 to 2020. They're designed in the classic isometic illustration style pioneered by early 2.5d games in the 90s, including SimCity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once desighed, buildings were divided into parts, loaded into an SVG generator and paired with on-chain random number generation to create unique generative buildings.
      </p>

      <p>
        BlockCities was the first project to instrument demand-based dynamic price. When the BlockCities Mystery Machine went live for the first time in April of 2019, prices increased by 0.0003 ETH every time a building was minted and paid for. It decreased by the same amount every 50 blocks a new building was not minted. 
      </p>

      <p>
        This was effective on launch day as a surge of mints rolled in, but ineffective longterm as the price decreased significantly between mints. Uniswap's token-bonding modal is a vast improvement on this concept.
