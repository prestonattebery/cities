        About
      </h2>

      <p class="long">
        BlockCities was inspired by CryptoKitties and the erc721 token standard created in late 2017. At the time, I was a digital artist selling physical prints to profit on digital work. But when I saw CryptoKitties, I knew NFTs would change digital art forever.
      </p>

      <p class="long">
        Each building was meticulously designed over the course of two years from 2018 to 2020. They're designed in the classic isometic illustration style pioneered by early 3d games in the 90s, including SimCity.
      </p>

      <p class="long">
        Once designed, buildings were divided into parts, loaded into an SVG generator and paired with on-chain random number generation to create unique generative buildings. Classics are clones of real-world buildings. Specials are custom designed buildings which can be 1 of 1's or limited run duplicates.
      </p>

      <p class="long">
        BlockCities was the first NFT project to instrument demand-based dynamic pricing. When the BlockCities Mystery Machine went live for the first time in April of 2019, prices increased by 0.0003 ETH every time a building was minted and paid for. It decreased by the same amount every 50 blocks a new building was not minted. 
      </p>

      <p class="long">
        This was effective on launch day as a surge of mints rolled in, but ineffective longterm as the price decreased significantly between mints. Uniswap's token-bonding modal is a vast improvement on this concept.
      </p>

      <p class="long">
        BlockCities started as collectibles, became a game, and are now just collectibles. You can buy them on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/blockcities" target="_blank">Opensea.</a>
